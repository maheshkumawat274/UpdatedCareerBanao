The university holds all the rights to accept or reject a candidate based on their academics and scores. While calling candidates for counselling on the Sanskriti University campus, the university evaluates their performance and creates a merit list. As the Sanskriti University cut off is not made available, students are then informed about their selection and then they have to complete the admission formalities respectively. ",
